A Deep Q-Learning model written from scratch with TensorFlow and Keras to beat the classic game Pong

Note: This project is a work in progress, completed trained models and a proper readme description to be added soon. For now, feel free to go through the code and comments, and try running game_env.py to play the game or train_AI.py to watch the neural network train.
